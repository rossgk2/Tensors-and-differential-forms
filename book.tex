    The source that is most frequently used is \cite{book::SM}; this is a comprehensive reference for differential geometry and manifolds. Explanations in \cite{book::SM} are generally good, but results sometimes are not motivated in the best way, and connections between concepts are sometimes missed. Following \cite{book::SM}, we have used \cite{book::Hubbard} the second-most. The book \cite{book::Hubbard} possibly has the best motivation I have ever seen in a math book. The definition of the exterior derivative and proof of the generalized Stokes' theorem were adapted from \cite{book::Hubbard}.
