\section*{Acknowledgements}

A special word of thanks goes to Josh Davis for supervising my independent study in differential forms.

Most of all, thank you to \code{/u/DankKushala}, \code{/u/Tazerenix}, and \code{/u/ziggurism} for answering my questions about tensors and differential geometry on \url{reddit.com/r/math}. Much of my understanding of the concepts in this book is due to your excellent answers.
