# Why read this book?

There are many books about tensors and/or differential forms, and probably all of them are written by people who know more about differential forms than me. So why read this book? Well, here is why. In the book,

* Extremely convenient notation for the matrix of a linear function $\mathbf{f}$ relative to bases $E$ and $F$, $\[\mathbf{f}(E)\]_F$, is given.
* Tensors are presented in a linear algebra context before moving to the manifold context. Trying to learn tensors all at once in the manifold context is too much, in my opinion. There is plenty that needs investigation in the simpler setting of vector spaces.
* The definition of an abstract tensor product space, which emphasizes the algebraic properties of tensors and does away with misleading implementation details, is used as much as possible. Treating tensors this way demystifies the various pushforward and pullback maps.
* The connection between the abstract tensor product space and the common definition of a tensor product space, in which $(f \otimes g)(\mathbf{v}\_1, \mathbf{v}\_2) = f(\mathbf{v}\_1) g(\mathbf{v}\_2)$, is given. The pushforward and pullback operations in this later space are deduced from the more understandable and natural pushforward and pullback 
* It is explained why $(p, q)$ tensors are defined to be what they are and it is explained why dual spaces and tensor product spaces are important. Unfortunately, I have found that no other book satisfactorily does this.
* Change of basis theorems for tensors and tangent vectors are easily understable because they can leverage the notation and theore
* The determinant is not immediately defined as the factor of multiplication on the top exterior power; this abstract characterization is proved as a theorem after 
* Differential forms are defined by using an abstract wedge product analagous to the abstract tensor product.
* The uncommon geometric definition of the exterior derivative involving flux through a parallelapiped is used and the most common algebraic definition is shown to be a consequence of this.

## Chapter 1: review of logic, proofs, and functions

As of Jan. 25 2021, an in-progress chapter on logic and proofs is now included in the book. Though incomplete, this section may still be helpful. In particular, a proof-writer of any level might appreciate the section on the implication operator =>, as this operator is often only halfway understood and badly explained. The chapter is complete up until the "Set difference and set complement" section. (A historical note: the content of this chapter that is complete was written in 2020, long before Jan. 25 2021; it is on Jan. 25 2021 that I decided to include this material in the compiled PDF).
