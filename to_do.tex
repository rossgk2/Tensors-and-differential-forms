\chapter*{To do}

This is a list of items that must be completed before I consider this book truly complete.

\section*{Standardize theorem and proof style}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Statement of hypotheses.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Possible styles:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item “Let $x$ have $P(x)$, $y$ have $Q(y)$, and $z$ have $R(z)$. Then … $S(x, y, z)$”
            \item “If $x$ has $P(x)$ and $y$ has $Q(y)$ then …”
            \item “$Q(x)$ for all $x$ with $P(x)$”.
            \item “Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces. If $\ff:V \rightarrow W$ is a linear function, then …”
            \item “If $\ff:V \rightarrow W$ is a linear function, where $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces, then …”
        \end{itemize}
        \item Definite changes to make:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For proofs of trivial kernel, always say ``Let $\ff(\vv) = \mathbf{0}$. We need to show $\vv = \mathbf{0}$.'' Make sure the ``We need to show $\vv = \mathbf{0}$'' part is never skipped.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Restatement of hypotheses in proofs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item shorthand: “If f has <most relevant property from theorem>, then blah blah blah…” 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Which equations should be in the align environment and which should be inline?
    \item Which align environment equations should have ``for all $x$'' inside them, like

    \begin{align*}
        y = f(x) \text{ for all $x$},
    \end{align*}
    
    and which equations should have ``for all $x$'' after the equation, in inline text?
    \item Don't explicitize objects if their explicitization isn't need in the theorem statement. Explicitize them in the proof only as necessary. (e.g. don't state "let $E = \{\ee_1, ..., \ee_n\}$ be a basis of $V$ if it is not necessary to have explicit descriptions of the basis vectors.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Especially, don't state "let $V$ be a vector space over a field $K$" if $K$ is not needed in the theorem statement. Instead, say "let $K$ be the field under $V$" in the proof.
        \item Add a definition of \textit{under $K$} in the definition of vector space over $K$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Add more explanatory text in-between definitions, lemmas, theorems where needed.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Logic and proofs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Proof of $\forall x \in S \spc P(x)$ is formally a proof by cases; we don’t write out the case $x \notin S$ because false hypothesis is obviously true
    \item Remove $-$ as notation for set difference and use $\\$ instead. Add an explanation that $-$ isn’t used because $S - T$ is often defined to mean $\{ s - t | s \in S \text{ and } t \in T\}$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Misc.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use $()$ for bases instead of $\{\}$. Make a remark after definition of basis about $()$ vs. $\{\}$
    \item vector fields should be denoted as $v$, not $\VV$, since a continuous map sending $\pp \mapsto v_\pp$ is a vector field
    \item in ``coordinates of tensors'' section of ``bilinear forms'' chapter, make sure never see expressions like $([\FF]_E)^i_j$, only $([\FF]_E)^i{}_j$
\end{itemize}

\section*{Dot product}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rewrite dot product section. My ||proj|| doesn’t work. Need to use sproj; projection must be signed, and $n$-dimensional angle approach isn’t actually easier for the beginner to understand; way more inductive proofs with complicated functions are required than I thought.
    \item \textbf{After more thought, have determined that approach in which angle is defined first is too pedagogically confusing. Said approach quickly establishes that the geometric and algebraic formulas for the dot product are equal, but it doesn’t give a sense as to why these formulas must be equal. A beginner using this approach isn’t guaranteed to be strongly motivated to ask “why?”, since it’s clearly established that it is so.
    \item Best approach will be to start in $\R^2$. Define geometric dot product and appeal to physical work for motivation. Show geometric => algebraic by using linearity. Then show algebraic => geometric by using invariance of dot product under rotation. Then generalize to $\R^n$ by using the algebraic formula.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{More dot product edits (may or may not be relevant given outline for new approach above)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Check defn of vector projection and make sure “some $\vv_\perp$” is used instead of “the $\vv_\perp$”
    \item Minimize amount of dot product facts used in the “prerequisites to understanding the dot product” section. The facts used are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dot product is zero for perpendicular vectors
        \item Handle geom => alg and alg => geom by starting with geometric formula, showing it’s equal to a formula involving a projection, and going from there.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Facts that should be in alg => geom section:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\vv, \vv_\perp$ is a basis for $\R^2$
        \item orthogonal linear functions preserve dot product
        \item rotated projection is projection involving rotated vectors
    \end{itemize}
    \item Facts that should be in geom => alg section:
    \item Proof that geom dot product is linear
    \item Might have proof about orthogonal linear functions preserving quantities elsewhere in book. Can reference it with a footnote
\end{itemize}

\section*{Orthogonal complements}

ADD A CHAPTER ON ORTHOGONAL COMPLEMENTS.

\begin{itemize}
    \item (Defn). A \textit{hyperplane} is an orthogonal complement of a one-dimensional vector subspace.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Important to have this so that can talk about visualizing linear equations as hyperplanes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Systems of linear equations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Since $\{\text{solns}\} = \ker(\AA) + \{\vv_p\}$ then it must be true that $\rref(\AA | \bb) = (\rref(\AA) | \vv_p)$. Must $\vv_p$ be unique? Yes. (Because there exists a product $\EE$ of elementary matrices such that $\rref(\AA) = \EE \AA$; we have $\vv_p = \EE \bb$. So, might be best to start chapter with solving equations with augmented matrices rather than the theoretical result solns = $\{\text{solns}\} = \ker(\AA) + \{\vv_p\}$, since the former result secretly includes the later.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Tensors}

\begin{itemize}
    \item choosing an inner product implies a choice of basis, because it implies a choice of orthonormal basis. revisit the remark on when unnatural isomorphism is natural
    \item Replace $V \totimes W := \LLLL(V^* \times W^* \rightarrow K)$ with $V \totimes W := V^{**} \totimes W^{**} = L(V^* \times W^* \rightarrow K)$.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Antisymmetry chapters}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Shift framing from “construction of wedge product” to “relationship between wedge and otimes”.}
    \item (Theorem). There is a natural isomorphism $\Lambda^k(V) \cong \alt(V^{\otimes k}$). That is, every wedge product can be identified with an antisymmetric tensor.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lemma. Every antisymmetric tensor $\TT$ is of the form $\TT = \alt(\TT)$.

        Proof of lemma. For one containment: we've seen that $\alt(\TT)$ is antisymmetric for all $\TT$. For the other: we've also seen that $\TT$ is alternating then $\TT = \alt(\TT)$.

        \item Proof of theorem. $\vv_1 \wedge ... \vv_k \mapsto \alt(\vv_1 \otimes ... \otimes \vv_k)$ defines an isomorphism $\Lambda^k(V) \rightarrow \alt(V^{\otimes k})$ on elementary wedge products. Extend it with seeming-the linearity and seeming-alternatingness of $\wedge$. 
    \end{itemize}

    \item antisymmetric tensors only make sense for $V^{\otimes k}$, not $V_1 \otimes … \otimes V_k$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item search “alternating”
        \item search “antisym”
        \item search $V_1$ with case sensitivity to find places to fix
        \item lots of edits in “as functions” section for this
        \item find places where swap and permutation are mentioned and make them all consistent with this
    \end{itemize}
    \item Add a footnote somewhere that we can't define $\wedge$ before $\det$ because we have to know that volume should be oriented before we get the idea for ``the oriented volume parallelopiped spanned by $\vv_1, ..., \vv_k$''. And to know volume should be oriented, we first have to explore the determinant and orientation.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cross product}

\begin{itemize}
    \item When Hodge-dual is used to generalize vector calculus theorems, remind reader that Hodge-dual was introduced in cross product section. 
    
    Emphasize that Hodge-dual is basically a generalized cross product. This perspective implies the abstract definition of the Hodge-dual that involves orthogonal subspaces, which is often pulled out of thin air in other presentations. (So maybe prove that the Hodge-dual satisfies this condition involving orthogonal subspaces as a result of it satisfying cross-product like condition. Now that I think about it, this proof will be analogous to proving that $\vv \times \ww$ is perpendicular to $\vv$ and $\ww$ by using the defn of $\times$. This means that definition of Hodge dual will be in cross product section, so can remove definition snear vector calculus stuff).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Orientation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove definition that an “n rotation” is a composition of extensions to 2-rotations. Gives the idea that rotations about arbitrary axes are such compositions, which is true, but isn’t proven at the time of the definition, or even soon after. We don’t need to know that rotations about arbitrary axes are compositions of extensions to 2-rotations to benefit from how they help us formalize the idea of orientation.
    \item Probably get rid of “extension of 2 rotation” and just say “2-rotation”
    \item Could be of help: https://analyticphysics.com/Higher%20Dimensions/Rotations%20in%20Higher%20Dimensions.htm
\end{itemize}

\section*{Manifolds and differential forms}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item Figure out the unexplained step in Theorem \ref{ch::diff_forms::thm::integral_of_diff_form_actual_function_single_chart}. Somehow, $d\xx \Big( \frac{\pd}{\pd \tx^i_{(V, \yy)}} \Big) = \frac{\pd \xx}{\pd \tx^i_{(V, \yy)}}$. 
    \item Finish the section in ``Manifolds'' on frames and coframes.
    \item Figure out why the ``mnemonic'' of the ``Manifolds'' chapter works.
    \item Add the divergence theorem and the less general Stokes' theorem (and Green's theorem) after the generalized Stokes' theorem.
    \item Potentially relocate the section about differential forms in $\tOmega^k(M)$ that act on tangent vectors. Potentially the presentation of  tensors/differential forms as actual (pointwise) multilinear functions.
    \item Explain more explicitly how the cancellation in part 3 of the proof of \ref{ch::diff_forms::theorem::stokes_on_a_smooth_chart} occurs. (``all the internal boundaries in the sum $\sum_{C \in D_N(\cl(\H^k))} \int_{\pd C}$ cancel, since each boundary appears twice with opposite orientations'').
\end{itemize}
