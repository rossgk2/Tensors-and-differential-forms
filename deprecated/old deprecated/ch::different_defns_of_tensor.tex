\subsubsection{Pushforward and pullback}

(Pullback). Originally was $(\otimes_q \ff^*)(\phi^1 \otimes ... \otimes \phi^q) = \ff^*(\phi^1) \otimes ... \otimes \ff^*(\phi^q)$, extended linearly. Now have $(\ootimes_q \ff^*)(\phi^1 \otimes ... \otimes \phi^q) = (\ff^*(\phi^1) \ootimes ... \ootimes \ff^*(\phi^q)) = ((\phi^1 \circ \ff) \ootimes ... \ootimes (\phi^q \circ \ff)) = ((\phi^1 \circ \ff) \ootimes ... \ootimes (\phi^q \circ \ff)) = (\phi^1 \circ \ootimes ... \ootimes \phi^q) \circ \ff$. Check this last equality by evaluating both sides on $(\vv_1, ..., \vv_q)$. Extending linearly, we see $(\ootimes_q \ff^*)(\TT) = \TT \circ \ff = \ff^*(\TT)$. That is, $(\ootimes_q \ff^*)(\TT)(\vv_1, ..., \vv_q) = \TT(\ff(\vv_1), ..., \ff(\vv_q))$.

\subsection{Differential forms}

\begin{theorem}
    (Pullback of a differential form).
    
    Recall from [...] that if $W$ and $Z$ are vector spaces of dimension and $\gg:W \rightarrow Z$ is a linear map, then the pullback $\Lambda^k \gg^*:\Lambda^k(Z^*) \rightarrow \Lambda^k(W^*)$ is defined by $\gg^*(\TT) = \TT \circ \gg = \gg^*(\TT)$. Therefore, the above definition implies
    
    \begin{align*}
        \Big( (\overline{\Omega^k} \ff^*)(\omega) \Big)_\pp = \omega_{\ff(\pp)} \circ d\ff_\pp = (d\ff_\pp)^*(\omega_{\ff(\pp)}).
    \end{align*}
    
    Therefore
    
    \begin{align*}
        (\overline{\Omega^k} \ff^*)(\omega) = \omega_{\ff(\pp)} \circ d\ff_\pp.
    \end{align*}
    
    More explicitly, $(\overline{\Omega^k} \ff^*)(\omega)$ is defined at each point $\pp \in M$ by
    
    \begin{align*}
        \Big((\overline{\Omega^k} \ff^*)(\omega) \Big)_\pp (\vv_1, ..., \vv_k) = \omega_{\ff(\pp)}(d\ff_\pp(\vv_1), ..., d\ff_\pp(\vv_k)).
    \end{align*}
\end{theorem}
