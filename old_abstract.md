*Below is the abstract for my senior thesis talk at Carleton College. I'm including it here because it serves as a good overview of this textbook. (The talk covered themes from the textbook).*

Let's talk vector calculus. Remember div, grad, and curl? Green’s theorem? The divergence theorem? Maybe Stokes’ theorem? These ideas are beautifully generalized by the notion of differential forms, which are algebraic objects invented to be integrated over “multidimensional surfaces”. We will briefly introduce differential forms and present the generalized Stokes’ theorem, which is a very general version of the fundamental theorem of calculus. The generalized Stokes’ theorem is deceptively simple in appearance; it looks simpler than the theorems it generalizes!

After introducing differential forms, we ponder a central theme of calculus: using limiting processes to produce smooth objects from finite ones. Can we do anything interesting if we reverse this process? That is, what if we start with a smooth theory and then discretize? We will present how differential forms, when discretized, can be utilized to solve problems in computer graphics. Namely, we will show how discrete differential forms can be used to “smooth out details” on a surface and to wrap a two-dimensional map around a globe in an angle-preserving manner.
